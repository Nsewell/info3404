\section*{Question 4}
Consider the query: For the salary ranges, $40,000 to $49,999; $50,000 to $59,999; $60,000 to $69,999 and $70,000 to $79,999, order the employees by ssnum. These are effectively four queries. Is there a way where ordering is only done once ? Again test your answer on real data.
