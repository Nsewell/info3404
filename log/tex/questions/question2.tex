\section*{Question 2}
Find employees with the name Smith or who are in the acquisitions department. Is there another way to write this query. Which one is perhaps more efficient?

A UNION statement can be used to get the same result. Marginal difference in time were observed, with the UNION statement slower, because it runs two queries. 

The first query does one sequential scan, matching each row against two conditions
\begin{lstlisting}
Seq Scan on employee  (cost=0.00..25.00 rows=88 width=8)
  -> Filter: (((name)::text = 'Smith'::text) OR ((dept)::text = 'acquisitions'::text))
\end{lstlisting}

The second query takes longer, needing to run two sequential scans, and a sort.
\begin{lstlisting}
Unique  (cost=48.72..49.16 rows=88 width=8)
  ->  Sort  (cost=48.72..48.94 rows=88 width=8)
        Sort Key: public.employee.ssnum
        ->  Append  (cost=0.00..45.88 rows=88 width=8)
              ->  Seq Scan on employee  (cost=0.00..22.50 rows=2 width=8)
                    Filter: ((name)::text = 'Smith'::text)
              ->  Seq Scan on employee  (cost=0.00..22.50 rows=86 width=8)
                    Filter: ((dept)::text = 'acquisitions'::text)
\end{lstlisting}
