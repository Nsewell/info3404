\section*{Question 1}
Which of the above two queries is more efficient and under what circumstances ?

The query with ssnums is substantially faster.
Ssnum is a big integer, while the name is a variable length character string that can be a much larger size and takes longer to hash.
There is a clustered index on ssnum which makes lookup faster than the unclustered index on name.

Ssnums are always guaranteed to be unique, while names may not necissarily be so.
